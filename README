== Welcome to LOOP CHAT!

This is a dead simple proof of concept for a chat the comet way.

My motivation for creating this proof of concept is the lack of DEAD SIMPLE implementations of commet around.

* It can run only on threaded mongrel
* It uses an application level variable ($msg) as the "holder" of last message
* Opens a connection to server (/love/getter) and holds it for 5 seconds or until $msg is modified -
  then it refreshes the connection and adds the new msg (if there is such) to the thread
* I used iframes instead of Ajax requests to make it even simpler to demonstrate the concept
* For real world usage I would recommend using REDIS or FILES to storage the conversations,
  and to use the mongrels application level variable to let the client know if it should AJAX for the new message from another ACTION
* For the client side you should probably use some simple FLASH object to open the connection, to avoid the constant "loading..." message
* ENJOY!
